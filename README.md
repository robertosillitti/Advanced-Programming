# Advanced-Programming (Algorithms and Data Structures)
This repository serves as a practical reference for implementing and testing algorithms and data structures in Python.

It contains materials and Python implementations developed during the Advanced Programming course focusing on algorithms, data structures, and advanced programming techniques, combining both theoretical foundations and practical applications in Python.

## Repository Structure
1. Algorithms.py:
This script includes the implementation and analysis of fundamental algorithms, with a particular focus on sorting and searching techniques.
Implementation of Insertion Sort and its empirical time complexity analysis (best, average, and worst-case scenarios).
Implementation of Merge Sort, Binary Search, Selection Sort, Quick Sort and Randomized Quick Sort. 

2. Dll Queues Stacks Trees.py:
This script provides object-oriented implementations of several classical data structures with examples and small tests to demonstrate functionality and correctness, including:
- Doubly Linked Lists (with methods for insertion, deletion, search, and traversal).
- Queues (enqueue/dequeue operations).
- Stacks (push/pop operations).
- Binary Search Trees (insertion, search, traversal, and minimum value retrieval).

As the course progresses, further content will be added, including:
- Advanced topics in Python: exceptions, file system access, comprehensions, iterators, generators, enumerate, zip, lambda functions, unpacking.
- Additional data structures: hash tables and graphs.
- Algorithms on trees and graphs: balanced search trees, graph traversals, minimum spanning tree, shortest path, network flows and cuts.
